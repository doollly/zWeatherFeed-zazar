zWeatherFeed-zazar
==================

Personal repo for zWeatherFeed jQuery plugin from zazar.net

I work on this great plugin to add localization option.

French language in progress but anybody can add languages or custom words.

Look at the localized version of the Javascript file "jquery.zweatherfeed_localized.js" to understand, you will find in it:

* option.language : default is "en" but you can define anything in relation with the following var.

* var condition_codes  : code returned from Yahoo and associated description.

* var translated_text : some words or terms that need to be translated for the user.

Feel free to fork and make it your own way !

And visit the http://forum.zazar.net for informations about this plugin.
